# Monte Carlo Simulator

This project demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo methods to estimate probabilities and model uncertainty in complex systems.  

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It is particularly useful when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to derive.  

## Features
- Run simulations with a customizable number of trials  
- Estimate probabilities and expected values of random processes  
- Visualize distributions and outcomes with plots  
- Modular code structure for easy extension to different use cases  

## Example Use Cases
- Estimating the value of Ï€ through random sampling  
- Simulating stock price movements using stochastic models  
- Risk analysis in finance and operations  

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies (`requirements.txt`)  
3. Run the simulator with sample scripts or your own parameters
